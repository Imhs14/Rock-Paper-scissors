# ✊✋✌️ Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

A simple, interactive command-line implementation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game built with Python. This project demonstrates basic programming concepts like conditional logic, user input handling, and random number generation.

## 📝 Project Description

This is a digital version of the traditional hand game. The user plays against the computer, which makes its choice randomly. The program evaluates the choices and declares a winner for each round.

## 🎮 Game Rules

The winner is decided based on these classic rules:

* **Rock beats Scissors** (Rock crushes Scissors)
* **Scissors beats Paper** (Scissors cuts Paper)
* **Paper beats Rock** (Paper covers Rock)
* **Tie**: If both the player and the computer choose the same option, the round is a draw.

## 🚀 Features

* **Randomized AI**: The computer’s choice is completely random using Python's `random` module.
* **Score Tracking**: (Optional - *Add if your code tracks wins/losses*) Keeps track of the player's and computer's scores during the session.
* **Input Validation**: Ensures the user enters a valid choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
* **Clean CLI Interface**: Simple and easy-to-read text output.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

* **Python 3.x** installed on your machine.
